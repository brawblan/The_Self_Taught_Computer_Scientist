# Big O Notation
>**Time and Space Complexity are expressed using big O notation to show an algorithm's efficiency.**

<hr>

## **space complexity**
><p>the amount of memory space an algorithm needs</p>

**Types of Space complexity**
- fixed space
- data structure
- temporary space

## **time complexity**
><p>the maximum number of steps an algorithm takes to complete as <em>n</em> gets larger</p>

**Types of Time Complexity**
- constant time
- logarithmic time
- linear time
- log-linear time
- quadratic time
- cubic time
- polynomial time
- exponential time
