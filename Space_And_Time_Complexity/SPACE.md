# SPACE COMPLEXITY

## space complexity
- the amount of memory space your algorithm needs <br />
- includes fixed space, data structure, and temporary space
<hr>

## fixed space
- the amount of memory an algorithm requires
```js
let x = 1
const n = 5
for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
  x *= i
}
```
<p>This would be considered O(1), or constant time, because the algorithm does not require more space as <em>n</em> gets larger.</p>
<hr>

## data structure
- the amount of memory a program requires to store the data set
```js
```
<hr>

## temporary space
- the amount of memory an algorithm needs for intermediary processing
```js
```
