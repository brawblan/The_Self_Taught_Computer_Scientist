# THE SELF-TAUGHT COMPUTER SCIENTIST
## The beginner's guide to data structures and algorithms
`But in JavaScript this time`

---

The self-taught Computer Scientist by Cory Althoff is a fantastic book that could also be called "Data Structures and Algorithms for Dummies".

I've been learning to program for a little over two years at this writing and I can say that Cory, single handedly, made these two **HUGE** Computer Science concepts very accessible and gave me the confidence to know that I **CAN** be successful in CS. 

Cory's language of choice for this book was Python which pairs nicely with his other self-taught book "The Self-Taught Programmer". While this may be great for many, it wasn't as good for me. I was able to understand that concepts being taught and make sense of the Python way of solving these problems, but I wanted to make sure and work the problems in JS and also keep track of them to share with those that need it.
